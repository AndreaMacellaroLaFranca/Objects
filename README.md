# 🚀 Java OOP Exercises  

Welcome to my collection of **Java Object-Oriented Programming** exercises!  
This repo is a mix of different challenges and practice projects I worked on while studying Java during my course.  

## 📚 What’s Inside  
- 🏗️ **Classes & Objects** – the building blocks of OOP  
- 🔒 **Encapsulation** – getters, setters & access control  
- 🧬 **Inheritance** – extending and reusing code  
- 🎭 **Polymorphism** – method overloading & overriding  
- 🧩 **Abstract Classes & Interfaces** – abstraction & contracts  
- 🛠️ **Composition** – objects inside objects  
- 📦 **Collections & Generics** – lists, maps & type safety  

## ▶️ How to Run  
Clone the repo and run the exercises individually:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
